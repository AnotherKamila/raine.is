subtitle: Your data is your business, I don't want it.

_Last Updated: February 2026_

**TL;DR:
Aranet4Wear is an open-source, local-only utility that processes sensor
data entirely on your device with zero data collection, tracking, or
cloud connectivity.
**

Your data is your business, I don't want it. This Privacy Policy
explains how I handle your information (spoiler: I don't).

### 1. Data Collection

Aranet4Wear does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.
There are no accounts, no cookies, and it does not track your location.

### 2. Local Processing

The app functions by connecting directly to your Aranet4 device via
Bluetooth. All data retrieved from your sensor stays on your watch. It
is never sent to a cloud, a remote server, or any third party.

### 3. Permissions

The app may request the following permissions necessary to function:

- **Bluetooth/Nearby Devices:** To find and communicate with your
  Aranet4 sensor.
- **Location (Android requirement):** Older versions of Android require
  location access to scan for Bluetooth devices. This is never stored or
  used to track you.
- **Notifications:** Used to show the CO2 value in an Ongoing
  Notification, and to alert on high CO2 levels. These alerts are
  generated locally on your device.

### 4. Third-Party Sharing

Since we don't collect any data, we have nothing to sell, trade, or share with advertisers or third parties.

### 5. Changes to This Policy

If I ever decide to change how the app works, I will update this policy.
But given my opinions about sending data to the cloud, don't expect much to change.

### 6. Open Source & Transparency

Aranet4Wear is open-source software. The source code is available for
public audit. You (or anyone else) can verify that the app handles data
exactly as described in this policy by visiting the repository at
[sr.ht/~raine/Aranet4Wear](https://sr.ht/~raine/Aranet4Wear).
