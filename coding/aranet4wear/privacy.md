subtitle: Your data is your business, I don't want it.

_Last Updated: February 2026_

**TL;DR: Aranet4Wear operates entirely on your watch, processing sensor
data locally with absolutely no data collection, tracking, or
third-party sharing.**

Your data is your business, I don't want it. This Privacy Policy
explains how I handle your information (spoiler: I don't).

### 1. Data Collection

Aranet4Wear does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.
There are no accounts, no cookies, and it does not track your location.

### 2. Local Processing

The app functions by connecting directly to your Aranet4 device via
Bluetooth. All data retrieved from your sensor stays on your watch. It
is never sent to a cloud, a remote server, or any third party.

### 3. Permissions

The app may request the following permissions necessary to function:

- **Bluetooth/Nearby Devices:** To find and communicate with your
  Aranet4 sensor.
- **Location (Android requirement):** Older versions of Android require
  location access to scan for Bluetooth devices. This is never stored or
  used to track you.
- **Notifications:** Used to show the CO2 value in an Ongoing
  Notification, and to alert on high CO2 levels. These alerts are
  generated locally on your device.

### 4. Third-Party Sharing

Since we don't collect any data, we have nothing to sell, trade, or share with advertisers or third parties.

### 5. Changes to This Policy

If I ever decide to change how the app works, I will update this policy.
But given my opinions about sending data to the cloud, don't expect much to change.
