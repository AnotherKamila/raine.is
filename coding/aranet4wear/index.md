title: Aranet4Wear
subtitle: Displays Aranet4 sensor data on a smartwatch.
---

Android Wear smart watch app that displays Aranet4 sensor data.

Lets you select an Aranet4 device and displays its reading.  
Stays open in ambient mode, so you can use it as an "alternative watch face".  
Gives haptic feedback on CO2 level changes (green/yellow/red as configured on the sensor through the Aranet Home app).
