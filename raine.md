title: Raine is Raine
---

Raine doesn't like boxes*. Genders are rather silly boxes, so Raine prefers to avoid them. 

\*Well, technically, Raine's relationship to boxes is like a cat's - don't put them in one if you like your face, but they might climb into one for a while if it is sufficiently inconvenient. 

Gendered terms I use:
- sir (ideally as siryessir)
- crazy cat lady
- weird aunt

Pronouns: they/them
